# Summary

The Lithuanian dependency treebank ALKSNIS v3.0 (Vytautas Magnus University).

# Introduction

This is a conversion of the ALKSNIS treebank to Universal Dependencies.
The original treebank was annotated in a style derived from the Prague Dependency Treebank of Czech.
The original treebank is available at
[https://github.com/Semantika2/Alksnis-v.3.0](https://github.com/Semantika2/Alksnis-v.3.0).
ALKSNIS v2.1 is published in the CLARIN LT repository at
[http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11821/10](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11821/10).

configuring the client machine to use 8.8.8.8 as the DNS server may help.

ALKSNIS v3 consists of 3,643 syntactically annotated sentences.
Each node of a tree corresponds to a word, a punctuation mark or other text
element (symbol, digit etc.) within a sentence. The following information is
presented for each node: 1) a used form; 2) a lemma; 3) a morphology tag,
and 4) a syntactic function (subject, object, etc.). Dependencies are shown
by links between words.

The morphology tag set Jablonskis is used since ALKSNIS v2.2 and in the XPOS
column of the UD conversion. This is a change from ALKSNIS 2 where a version
of the MULTEXT-East tag set was used.
<!--A version of the MULTEXT-East
(http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V4/msd/html/index.html)
tag set is used in ALKSNIS v2 and in the XPOS column of the UD conversion.-->
Syntactically annotated sentences
are corrected according to guidelines that were created by scientists of
VMU CCL, following rules of Prague Dependency Treebank. All the sentences are
being manually checked and corrected by a group of linguists.

# Acknowledgements

From v2.1 to v3.0 the treebank was developed within the project "Semantika2"
(Nr. 02.3.1-CPVA-V-527-01-0002). The project was funded by European Structural Funds.
